                    <li><b>New York Steak:</b> It is best to let your steak sit on the countertop at room temperature
                        for 30
                        minutes prior to cooking.

                            temperature. Salt
                            and pepper to taste.

                            to smoke add the steaks to the skillet. Sear on all of the sides until they have a golden
                            brown crust.
                            Add the butter and let melt in the skillet. Add in the garlic and fresh sprigs.

    <h3><i>Tips For the Best New York Skillet Seared Steak</h3></i>
    <p>
        <br>
</div>

<div>
    <ul style="list-style-position:inside; margin-left:-15px margin-right:-30px">
        <p>
            <li><b>Pan:</b> Your best bet is to use a heavy bottomed pan. I love using my cast iron skillet for this
                purpose. It evenly distributes the heat to the meat so it cooks evenly.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Room Temperature:</b> Allow your steak to come to room temperature, let it sit about 20-30
                minutes on the counter. The closer it is to your final temperature before cooking results in the
                steak cooking evenly, as it won’t have any “cold” spots.
            </li>
        <p>
            <li><b>Pat It Dry:</b> You want your steak to be dry for the best possible searing. Water will steam
                your steak, which isn’t ideal.
            </li>
        <p>
            <li><b>Let it Rest: </b> I can’t emphasize this enough. Meat should always be allowed to rest before
                cutting into it. This allows the juices to be redistributed throughout the meat and the fibers to
                relax. This will result in your New York Steak being tender and juicy every time. Place your New
                York Steak on a warm plate and loosely cover with foil for 5 minutes. Don’t cover it tightly as it
                will make your steak sweat. 5 minutes is all you’ll need, you don’t want it to get cold.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Make Sure your Pan is Hot:</b> You want to really sear the outside of your steak and create a
                golden crust. Make sure your pan and oil are hot.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Use a High Smoke Oil: </b>To produce an ideal crust you’ll want a high smoke oil, such as canola,
                grape-seed, peanut or avocado oil. This will produce the best flavor and texture. Lower smoke oils
                can ruin the flavor.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Use Different Herbs:</b> New York Steak is the darling of steaks, it doesn’t necessarily need a
                lot of seasoning to taste great. But you can definitely make the steak to your liking using sage,
                rosemary, thyme, garlic or any grill seasonings and mixes you desire.
            </li>
        </p>
    </ul>
